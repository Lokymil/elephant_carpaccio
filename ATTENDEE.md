You will have to develop a server that will receive an e-shopping cart and it will return a calculated invoice. You won't have to create everything from scratch, there are multiple bootstrap in different languages. Check out below to choose your favorite.

If you have any questions about the rules you will have to implement, refer to your workshop leader.

#### :warning: Please do not look anywhere else you are ask to during the workshop, othserwise you will have more information than you should and make it pointless.

Be kind to you workshop leader and follow his/her instructions.

If you are curious, you can still look everywhere you like afterwards.
