# Elephant Carpaccio

This project is to be used to lead the Elephant Carpaccio workshop.  
It was initially designed by [Alistair Cockburn](https://alistair.cockburn.us/coming-soon/) to help developers and teams to understand the importance of splitting bigger tasks into smaller tasks.  
You will find here my own interpretation of the original workshop and a tool to easily lead it to make your team grow.

To make it as efficient as possible, any feedback or PR is welcomed.
